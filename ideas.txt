The idea is to 
  1. install Dropbox on one of my servers
  2. Have a watchdog such as the python watchdog or grunt
  3. It reacts to a file change and does either...
    - commits new file overwriting old file in git repo, then pushes to GitHub
    - runs markdown itself and hosts the resulting HTML along with a CSS file
